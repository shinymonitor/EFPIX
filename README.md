# EFPIX (Encrypted Flood Protocol for Information eXchange)
EFPIX is a flood-based relay communication protocol that enables end-to-end encryption, plausible deniability, and untraceable messaging. It is resistant to changes in topology and infrastructure failures. It is also designed to hide metadata, like sender and receiver, from those not invo
It is ideal for peer-to-peer, privacy-focused communication, such as journalism, whistleblowing, activism, or general secure messaging. 
It also excels in environments where centralized infrastructure is unstable or infeasible, such as disconnected regions, totalitarian regimes, or disaster-struck areas.
